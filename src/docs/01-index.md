**This styleguide is under development. Please, refer to the [official one](http://dsi-vd.github.io/foehn/).**

## Design your service using VD.CH styles, components and patterns

Use this design system to make your service consistent with GOV.UK. Learn from the research and experience of other service teams and avoid repeating work that’s already been done.

## Content & hierarchy

All the components are organized accordingly to the [atomic design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) philosophy by Brad Frost.<br>
You can navigate through all theses components with the help of the left side navigation bar.

Additionally, a few example pages are designed to give an overview of all these elements integrated together

## Changes

All changes are documented [here](https://github.com/DSI-VD/foehn-design-system/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
